//server-side frameworks and how is using them, and a bit off why (need to be redone):
//
//    Ruby on Rails: This Ruby framework is the overriding way to implement Ruby. Its “gems” include plug-ins and libraries
//    of code that streamline development.
//
//    ASP.NET: This Microsoft framework is the most popular enterprise-level framework—it supports multiple programming
//    languages simultaneously for one project. So, the same application can be built with both C# and C++, via CLI
//    (common language interface). It’s most recent iteration, ASP.NET 5, is now open to non-Windows platforms for the
//    first time.
//
//    Django: This Python framework was developed to meet the needs of development in a fast-paced environment.
//    Django sites: Pinterest, Nasa, Pitchfork
//
//    Node.js: JavaScript is typically a front-end script, but with the Node.js framework, it can be used in
//    server-side technology, from APIs to entire stacks. Its core selling point is how it handles client-server
//    communication—it’s fast, doesn’t bottleneck, and is ideal for real-time apps like chat rooms, data-heavy
//    applications, and any software that requires the streaming of fresh content, like a news feed.
//    Node.js sites: Dow Jones, PayPal, LinkedIn
//
//    Express.js & Koa: These JavaScript-powered middleware frameworks work on top of the Node.js development environment
//    and control the flow of information on the back end of a site.
